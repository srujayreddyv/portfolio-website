- Architected a full stack second brain application using Next.js with TypeScript, FastAPI, and Supabase, enabling secure note capture, search, tagging, and archive workflows with strict per user data isolation.

- Implemented JWKS based JWT authentication, consistent API error handling, rate limiting, automated GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines, and workflow level test coverage to ensure production reliability.
