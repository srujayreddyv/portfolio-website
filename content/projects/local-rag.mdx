- Built a local RAG pipeline using Hugging Face Transformers for embeddings and Pinecone for vector search enabling context aware semantic retrieval across a 1,200 page nutrition textbook with 93% accuracy.

- Designed an evaluation workflow in MLflow to benchmark retrieval performance and refine prompt response relevance, improving contextual precision and ensuring readiness for cloud deployment.
