- Built and deployed a production-oriented RAG pipeline (Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, FAISS, sentence-transformers) over the California DMV handbook, with streaming Q&A, source citations, confidence gating, reranking, and multi-document filtering.

- Hardened reliability with Docker + Render deployment, lockfile-based reproducibility, CI automation (GitHub Actions), structured observability (/metrics, request IDs, error codes), rate limiting, and comprehensive PyTest coverage across API, retrieval, ingestion, and evaluation workflows.
