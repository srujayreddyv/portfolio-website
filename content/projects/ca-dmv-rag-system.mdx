architecture: "Built as a retrieval-augmented QA system with FastAPI services, FAISS vector search, sentence-transformers embeddings, and a Streamlit interface for streaming responses with citations and filtering."
productionReadiness: "Deployed with Docker on Render, with lockfile-based builds, structured API error handling, request IDs, rate limiting, and automated GitHub Actions CI checks."
validationChecks: "Covered API, ingestion, retrieval, reranking, and evaluation paths with PyTest to keep regressions controlled while iterating on chunking and ranking behavior."

- Built and deployed a production-oriented RAG pipeline (Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, FAISS, sentence-transformers) over the California DMV handbook, with streaming Q&A, source citations, confidence gating, reranking, and multi-document filtering.

- Hardened reliability with Docker + Render deployment, lockfile-based reproducibility, CI automation (GitHub Actions), structured observability (/metrics, request IDs, error codes), rate limiting, and comprehensive PyTest coverage across API, retrieval, ingestion, and evaluation workflows.
