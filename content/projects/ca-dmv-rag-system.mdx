- Built a RAG system using FastAPI, FAISS, and Sentence Transformers over the California DMV handbook, supporting streaming responses with citations, reranking, multi document filtering, and confidence gating.

- Deployed with Docker on Render, adding structured observability with metrics and request IDs, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, and comprehensive PyTest coverage across ingestion and retrieval workflows.
